Yogoflow automatically classifies and annotates sections of your video with the appropriate yoga move.

### How it's made

Yogoflow is a React app with a python backend. Uploaded videos are split into 1 second clips on the server, and a frame from each chunk is sampled.
The frame is processed using a conputer-vision model I built using <a href="https://roboflow.com/">Roboflow</a>. It's trained on a sample of around 1000 yoga poses.
The model inferences for each frame are "quantized" into regions, so noise is removed from the data and the poses are more stable.

The poses are then added as image overlays based on the style-config sent in the request, and the video is returned for download!

### How to use it

1. Upload a video of yourself doing yoga.
2. Choose where you want your captions displayed.
3. That's it! Yogoflow will automatically classify and annotate sections of your video with the appropriate yoga move.
4. Download your video.
